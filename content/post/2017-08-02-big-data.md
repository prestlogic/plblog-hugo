Big Data is the use of information to reveal trends and patterns of behaviour.  

 

It’s
 really helpful if you want to understand how your customers think, what
 drives them to make purchases or engage with services, and it can go a 
long way towards helping you develop a successful marketing strategy or 
business plan. 

 

Nowadays
 pretty much everything we do is recorded somewhere. Everything you 
search on Google, everything you purchase on your bank card, every journey you complete with your Oyster card all goes to a big data management system in the sky (AKA The Cloud).
